# Smsgh.UssdFramework (beta)

This is a successor to our previous [UssdFramework](http://github.com/smsgh/ussd-framework).

## Motivation

The previous [UssdFramework](http://github.com/smsgh/ussd-framework) was a nice foundation, but it fell short in a few areas.

* Explicit routing.
* Integrated session store.
* Step based flow.

__Smsgh.UssdFramework__ addresses these and a lot more.

## Features

* Plugable session store. `RedisStore` included.
* ASP.NET MVC / Web Api -ish controllers. 
* Dynamic routing.
